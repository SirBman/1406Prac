<p> My Name is Ben White. I am 18. I am part of the 00 program in the Australian branch, OZ6. I am also currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology as a cover so Spectre cant find me (they're idiots). I live at home with my Mum and Brother. Most of my day consists of playing military games such as ARMA 3 so i can learn new tactics and learn how Spectre works <span class="highlight"> (they used the bad guys in this game as a basis for their organisation. They really are idiots).</span> When im not doing that, i am drinking mountain dew and wrecking the scrubs on call of duty. </p> </section>
